Title: AI-Based Algorithmic Trading Bot Forex Client BackgroundClient: leading trading firm USAIndustry Type: FinanceServices: Trading, Banking, InvestmentOrganization Size: 100+The ProblemBuild ML/AI Model predict 15 historical live data indicators EMA, MACD, RSI etc. Create web app show predicted indicators movementOur SolutionIn market indicators EMA, MACD, RSI helps find historical data. accurately predict earlier investment. 12data api collect historical live EUR/USD data. calculated EMA(12), EMA(26), MACD RSI indicators based data. created labels historical data. training data classifier models training. predicted accuracy models Logistic regression model gave 91% accuracy. logistic regression predicting step. 15 minutes happen 15 earlier. predicted 45 minutes values LSTM model historical data. Based values calculated EMA, MACD RSI logistic regression. predict 1 hour earlier based 2 models. show indicators movement created python flask web app hosted AWS EC2 server. process runs 15 minutes checks cross. 1 hour sends telegram notification.DeliverablesFlask web app python code machine learning modelsTools usedPandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, flask etc.Language/techniques usedData Analysis, Data Visualization, Machine learning, Deep learning, flask web app etc.Models usedLogistic Regression, LSTM modelSkills usedData Analysis, Data Visualization, Machine learning, Deep learning, flask, python etc.Databases usedMongoDBWeb Servers usedAWS Ec2What technical Challenges Faced Project ExecutionMain challenge project find model. time series data change orders accuracy. machine learning model predicting 15 1 hour before.How Technical Challenges SolvedWe time series data change order find accuracy model. models order evaluated model. logistic regression model worked data gave 91% accuracy test data. 1 hour prediction logistic regression predict 3 steps failed poor accuracy. trained LSTM model data predicted 3 steps LSTM model. logistic regression predict cross.Business ImpactIt traders predict market earlier returns project.
