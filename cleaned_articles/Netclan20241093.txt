Title: Design & Develop Question Answering model explanations visualization Client BackgroundClient: Leading Tech Firm USAIndustry Type: ConsultingServices: Software, ConsultingOrganization Size: 100+Project DescriptionWe pre-trained question answering model create notebook explanations model’s working visuals bertviz, allennlp gradient values.Our SolutionWe created notebook explained model model view view visuals bertviz library. similarity words easily find related words.We allennlp library created bar charts heatmaps show higher attention words. finds question related words context higher words words related values. gradient based method show higher gradient values question text created bar charts text color charts show higher gradient values.Project DeliverablesA notebook explanation question answering model visualization.Tools usedGoogle colab notebooks, Tensorflow, Bertviz, Allennlp, TransformersLanguage/techniques usedPython programming language, Deep learning, NLP, Data VisualizationModels usedPretrained bert-base-uncased model distilbert model (both trained squad2 dataset) Skills usedData visualization, Deep learning, NLP, python technical Challenges Faced Project ExecutionWe pre-trained model give results questions answers.We working text data charts show differences higher attention attention words. Technical Challenges SolvedFor pretrained Bert’s pretrained models distilbert(trained squad dataset), distilbert(trained squad2), base uncased, base.Among models one. solving charts related issues heatmap chart, bar chart dark colors text coloring method.Project Snapshots Previous articleDesign develop solution anomaly detection classification problemsNext articleMedical Classification Ajay Bidyarthy RELATED ARTICLESMORE AUTHOR Integrating Machine Learning Code Kubeflow Pipeline – Kuberflow MLOps KubernetesFacial Recognition Attendance SystemFace Recognition DeepFace
