Title: Development EA Robot Automated Trading Objective:The goal project build Expert Advisor (EA) Robot automates trading predictions generated machine learning (ML) model. EA operate real-time, leveraging historical live data make buy/sell decisions. Data obtained primary methods:API: version limited data single currency pair, paid version offering access multiple pairs. Trading Platforms: FX Pro XM, serve direct sources real-time trading data.Additionally, EA Robot MQL5 script defines trading strategy, enabling automated trading MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform. focus train ML model predictive trading, integrate data streams, implement scalable MQL5 strategy execution.Key Steps:1. Project SetupAPI Platform Access:Obtain API credentials paid versions. Set FX Pro XM trading platforms retrieve login details. Ensure compatibility MetaTrader 5 (MT5) seamless integration. Test API Connection:Test API endpoints verify data retrieval currency pairs. ensures real-time data flow historical live trading.2. Data Retrieval PreparationAPI Data Integration:Set API connections retrieve historical live trading data. version provide access data single currency pair (e.g., EURUSD), paid version multiple pairs (e.g., GBPUSD, GOLD, USDCAD, etc.). FX Pro / XM Data Handling:Integrate FX Pro XM platforms data reading trade execution. Python MT5 libraries retrieve real-time data selected currency pairs. Historical Data Storage:Collect historical data model training, storing structured format (e.g., CSV) processing.3. Model Development TrainingFeature Engineering:Compute technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, EMA) selected currency pairs historical data. Generate buy/sell signals training, ensuring data reflects actual market patterns. Model Training:Develop train model historical data predict buy/sell signals choosing ML model ( XGBoost, LSTM, Reinforcement Learning) Focus ensuring model generalize unseen data respond effectively market changes. Model Evaluation:Evaluate model performance based metrics accuracy, precision, recall, profit optimization. Adjust fine-tune hyperparameters improved predictive performance.4. Backtesting Performance EvaluationBacktesting Framework Setup: Develop system test model historical data. Performance Metrics Definition: Define relevant metrics (e.g., ratio, drawdown). Strategy Backtesting: Run model historical data evaluate performance. Results Analysis: Analyze backtesting results identify areas improvement.5. Real-Time Data IntegrationReal-Time Data Handling:Set continuous data feeds APIs FX Pro/XM platforms, fetching real-time trading data regular intervals (e.g., 15 minutes). Ensure data cleaned, preprocessed, normalized fly live prediction purposes. Technical Indicators Calculation:Compute technical indicators real-time data, ensuring model up-to-date market conditions. Prediction Script:Develop scripts apply trained model real-time data generate buy/sell predictions.6. MQL5 Script DevelopmentStrategy Implementation:Develop MQL5 script includes trading strategy based model predictions creates interface system trading platform. script incorporate logic stop-loss, take-profit, position sizing, ensuring risk management integrated. Platform Compatibility:Ensure MQL5 script compatible MT5 platform easy deployment. Execution Trades:Implement system EA strategy execute trades automatically based modelâ€™s predictions._________________________________________________________________________This approach ensures development robust, data-driven EA Robot integrates ML predictions real-time trading platforms APIs. guarantees flexibility live trading currency pairs adaptability changing market conditions.
