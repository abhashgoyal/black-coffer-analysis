Title: ML technologies Evaluate Learning Assessments Client BackgroundClient: leading EduTech firm USAIndustry Type: EduTechServices: Educations. TrainingOrganization Size: 1000+Project ObjectiveConfirmation / Identification data / obtained bias.Understanding Actions required performed analytics.Converting data metrics formulae conduct analysis. Project DescriptionIt culture management platform learning fundamental mode communication. platform requires Analytics portion captures variety data related interaction learner content, assessments, engagements forums create personalized learning plans user increase effectiveness learning retention make impact productivity learner organization.Our SolutionWe helped client deciding data required analysis process. models tasks interpretations data collected analysed initial response, final response, retention, proficiency, learning intent user. designed models perform seamlessly grading question type (based difficulty level) hierarchical level (sub-section, section, training, on). knew user unique aptitude level (basic, intermediate, advanced) keeping mind, incorporated aptitude levels analytics too. Moreover, integrated grade time factor analysis points allotted comparatively tough questions responses, respectively.Project DeliverablesMS Excel sheet, Google spreadsheets proper tables visualizations. Tools usedJupyter notebook, MS Excel, Google Spreadsheets. Language/techniques usedPython.Skills usedData science analytics.Databases usedGenerated data data simulation.What technical Challenges Faced Project Execution?Data analytics analysing finding patterns data exist generated real-time. However, project budding stage, data start analysis. Moreover, project novel, dataset meets requirements impossible find online. Technical Challenges SolvedWe performed data simulation techniques generate data authentic libraries python random functions spreadsheets. generated data manually scale, made including human factor it.Project Snapshots (Minimum 10 Pictures) Previous articleDatawarehouse, Recommendations Engine AirBNBNext articleSplitting Songs Vocals Instrumental Ajay Bidyarthy RELATED ARTICLESMORE AUTHOR Integrating Machine Learning Code Kubeflow Pipeline â€“ Kuberflow MLOps KubernetesFacial Recognition Attendance SystemFace Recognition DeepFace
