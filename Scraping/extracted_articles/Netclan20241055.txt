Title: Healthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, Langchain Client BackgroundClient: A leading healthcare tech firm in the USAIndustry Type: HealthcareProducts & Services: Healthcare SolutionOrganization Size: 1000+Problem StatementOverview:The AI chatbot is required to assist eye care patients with various tasks, including booking appointments, tracking lens order statuses, reviewing patient dues, sending statements, and answering general questions about their eye exams and the practice.Requirements:Use of open-source LLM models like Llama, with training on custom data. Implementation of Q&A from custom static data. SaaS deployment to serve multiple hospitals/practices. Demonstration of sample chats using the custom-trained model early in the project. Deployment on optimized servers (preferably CPU-based for execution, GPU-based acceptable for training). Periodic testing, transition, and demos before payment release. Provision of APIs for communication with databases to fetch dynamic data.SolutionSolution Overview: Develop and deploy a custom-trained AI chatbot using an open-source LLM model (such as Llama) to assist eye care patients. This solution will be implemented as a SaaS offering, enabling multiple hospitals and practices to utilize the chatbot. The project will include the training of the LLM model on custom data, development of APIs for dynamic data interaction, and deployment on optimized servers.Steps:Model Training: Train the Llama model with custom data specific to eye care patient queries. API Development: Develop APIs to communicate with the hospital’s database for dynamic data retrieval (appointment booking, order status, patient dues). Deployment: Deploy the chatbot as a SaaS solution using optimized servers (CPU for execution, GPU for training). Testing and Demo: Conduct periodic testing and demos to ensure functionality and transition smoothly. Sample Chat Demonstration: Provide sample chats to demonstrate the effectiveness of the custom-trained model.Technology UsedLLM Model:Llama or another suitable open-source LLM model, trained with custom data only.Backend:Python (preferred), with a possibility of using C# for backend implementation if feasible.Deployment:Optimized CPU-based servers for execution, with GPU-based servers for initial model training.APIs:Custom-developed APIs for database interaction.DeliverablesCustom-Trained LLM Model:A Llama model trained with custom eye care data. APIs:APIs to handle appointment bookings, order status checks, patient dues reviews, and statement sending. SaaS Deployment:Deployment of the chatbot as a SaaS solution, accessible by multiple hospitals/practices. Sample Chats:Demonstration of the chatbot’s effectiveness with sample chats using the custom-trained model. Documentation:Detailed documentation of the technology stack, APIs, deployment steps, and user guide.Business ImpactImproved Patient Experience:Patients can easily book appointments, track orders, and get answers to their queries, leading to higher satisfaction. Operational Efficiency:Automation of routine tasks reduces the workload on staff, allowing them to focus on more critical tasks. Cost Savings:Utilizing open-source tools and optimized servers minimizes costs, avoiding recurring expenses associated with licensed software. Scalability:SaaS deployment allows multiple hospitals/practices to use the chatbot, enhancing scalability and reach. Data-Driven Insights:Custom APIs enable real-time data interaction, providing valuable insights into patient interactions and operational metrics.By leveraging the power of open-source LLM models and custom training, this AI chatbot will significantly enhance patient interaction and operational efficiency for eye care providers.Sample Chat ScenariosMilestone 1 Chat SamplesAppointmentsSample 101: Booking an AppointmentPatient:Hello, this is John Doe.
