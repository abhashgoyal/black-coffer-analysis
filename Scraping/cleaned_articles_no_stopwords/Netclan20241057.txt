Title: Recommendation Engine Insurance Sector Expand Business Rural Area Client BackgroundClient: leading insurance firm globeIndustry Type: InsuranceServices: SaaS, Products, InsuranceOrganization Size: 10000+Project ObjectiveDevelop recommendation engine Item-based collaborative filtering based project Work Streaming data platform i.e BangDb Data Generation Testing platformProject DescriptionBangDB platform manages static data stored cluster works live streaming data Hadoop does. bangdb manage machine learning model deployment inbuilt parameter hyper tuning parameters model.Streaming data client relates customer details products offered client platform, Insurance, loans (Business Loans Personal Loans), Mobile recharge, UPI transactions platform, etc. wanted recommendation services provided customers platform.Our SolutionThis Project Module develops Clients Requirements involves item-based collaborative filtering based customer behaviour, Firstly classify customers segments basis age, location, gender, product usage. basis RFM (marketing tactics classify customer basis purchase history, amount spend, frequency usage product) classify recommend services based item-based collaborative filtering.We generated synthetic data (90 events) testing recommendation model accuracy recommending products customers.Project Deliverables – KPI Customers – Recommendation model – Graph databased model – Data Generation code based python (using copula-based PyTorch) Tools usedBangDb Tool (ML, AI, NoSQL database supported) Graph Databased Google Colab (Data file generation) Tableau data visualization Language/techniques usedLinux machine Python Graph Database Data visualization toolsModels used-K model clustering-Recommendation Engine model-Collaborative based filtering modelSkills used– Machine learning– NoSQL Database – Graph database– Data Generation python– Linux – Data VisualizationDatabases used– BangDB– Graph Database– Microsoft MYSQL serverWeb Servers usedAWS serviceWhat technical Challenges Faced Project ExecutionDecide Recommendation Engine based Finding RFM score classifying customers clusters Graph Model define relations customers service Synthetic data generation(90 events) 1.5 Gb structured data.How Technical Challenges SolvedItem-based collaborative filtering solves issue recommendation dealing 14- 15 services. Clustering customers based similarities Measure RFM score, group classify based scores. Graph database reduce complexity increase processing speed. Data generation difficult tasks generating relational data 29 streams copula UUID python library function based PyTorch.Business ImpactIt Qualitative Quantitative impact economically customers direct impact projects life. suggesting customers services utilize provider direct impact product customers.
