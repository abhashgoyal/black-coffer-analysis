Title: Car Detection Satellite Images Client BackgroundClient: leading retail firm USAIndustry Type: RetailServices: Retail businessOrganization Size: 100+Project ObjectiveThe objective project detect cars satellite images highlight bounding box.Project DescriptionThe client, Schneider, approached requirement develop Python project dealt computer vision. aim project detect cars present satellite image highlight bounding box. achieve this, decided Darknet model train Yolov4 dataset cars satellite images.Our Solution Google Colab coding training Darknet model. Kaggle download Yolov4 dataset cars satellite images. preprocessed dataset trained model it. model trained, tested satellite images worked perfectly fine. Finally, created script detected cars image highlighted bounding box.Project DeliverablesThe final deliverable ipython Notebook presented Google Colab.Tools usedGoogle Colab, Kaggle, Slack(For Communication)Language/techniques usedPythonModels usedDarknet(CV Model)Skills usedPython programming, AI/ML.What technical Challenges Faced Project ExecutionThe challenge faced related pre-processing Yolov4 dataset cars satellite images. dataset cleaned formatted training model.How Technical Challenges SolvedWe Python programming skills developed script automated pre-processing dataset. saved lot time allowed focus training model.Business ImpactThe project success client happy final product. car detection model worked perfectly satellite images development application detect cars real-time.Project website url Video
