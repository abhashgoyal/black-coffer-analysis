Title: Data Management Political SaaS Application Client BackgroundClient: leading tech firm USAIndustry Type: ITServices: SaaS, ProductsOrganization Size: 100+The ProblemAs guidelines discussion. Political Research Automated Data Acquisition (PRADA) phases included.1. pics existing EOs (Elected Officials)2. EOs Pictures.3. Run QA checks regularly EOs4. data government Facebook pages.5. Geospatial project: Create version provided KML google earth. Creating nested directories contained description Map-URL designated location.6. data States Counties(Including Boroughs Parishes)By building automated generated structured data – programmer create config allowing bot scrap update data.Our SolutionWe created automated python scripts designated phases respective requirements. Solutions type problems varied data scrapping automation python developed scripts including geospatial KML task. addition ranges data scrapped generated directed output respective tasks form CSV format. user’s aim requirement achieved i.e. programmer create con-fig initiate bot scrap required data.Solution ArchitectureThe majority task project consisted web data scraping automation high- level overview, specific implementation details project follows:Web Scraping Framework: Python coding language tasks framework data scraping included Beautiful-Soup, Selenium Web drivers. libraries provide tools functionalities navigate web pages, extract data, handle HTML elements. Data Extraction Parsing: selected web scraping library extract desired data web pages provided data sheet websites URLs sheet. involves locating HTML elements, applying filters selectors, parsing extracted data. Data Processing: data extraction cleansed, transformed aggregated structured form pandas’ Data CSV file. geospatial task resulted generation nested folders kml file. Data Storage: store scrapped data determined local file system form CSV (Comma Separated Values). data storage solution project. addition geospatial task output form kml file polygons inside directories nested folders.

(Regular Expressions): powerful tool python sued pattern matching manipulations strings.Skills usedPython Programming Web Fundamentals Web Scrapping libraries BS, Selenium. Data Cleaning Processing Problem- Solving debugging. KML structure handling Python’s programming.Databases usedNone. structured data form python Data Frames, CSV Excel Sheets.What technical Challenges Faced Project ExecutionFirstly web URLs accessible restricted IPs region Couldn’t fetch data Beautiful Soup couldn’t parse tags. List Counties wasn’t provided resource linksHow Technical Challenges SolvedUsed VPN accessing Official generally accessible. Selenium Web automate direction URLs fetched complete html tags desired webpages. Performed search created structure data list counties input gain web URLs counties US.Business ImpactEnhanced Analysis: Web scraping businesses gather valuable data websites. information provide insights desired aim objectives enabling businesses make informed. Real-Time Monitoring Upgradation: Web scraping enable business monitor updates website real-time. tracking regulatory changes. business it’s data updated. Increased Efficiency: Automation eliminated data collection, saving time resources. automated web scraping, business extract amount data quickly, accurately, improving operational efficiency.Project SnapshotsChrome initiatedChrome visiting directed links accessing image URLsDirected linkKML taskFacebook Data extractionData Governments USAccessing links wiki directing countiesNesting list counties stateFinding Extracting website CountyProject website urlThe GitHub repository link:- Video
