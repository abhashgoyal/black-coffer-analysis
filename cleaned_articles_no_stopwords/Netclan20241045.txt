Title: Efficient Coach Allocation System Sports Coaching Organization Client BackgroundClient: leading sports tech firm USAIndustry Type: SportsProducts & Services: Consulting, Sports SaaS, Sports ManagementOrganization Size: 100+The ProblemThe sports coaching organization, Esra Salih, faced challenge efficiently allocating coaches programs schools. allocation process previously inefficient, leading inadequate coach-program matching inefficient coaches’ time. organization needed system automatically assign coaches programs based specific criteria coach availability, program preferences, number students enrolled program.Our SolutionWe developed custom system divides academic terms assigns coaches programs based set criteria. system filters coaches based preferences allocates programs efficiently. ensures coaches travel excessively total work time exceed threshold. coach assigned program, allocated subsequent program days, ensuring consistency.The development process involve stages:Understanding data: We’ll analyze data identify relevant variables constraints. include locations installations, duration installations, availability team members, customer preferences. Defining objective constraints: objective minimize total travel time maximize number installations completed time frame. constraints include geographical distances locations, working hours team members, specific requirements installation. Implementing algorithm: We’ll optimization algorithm, Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver, find optimal routes. algorithm routes choose meets objectives adhering constraints. Running simulations: ensure feasibility model, we’ll run simulations scenarios adjust parameters needed. Saving output: final output suggested schedules, reviewed approved relevant parties.In terms technology, we’ll Python, popular language data analysis machine learning. We’ll Anaconda distribution, powerful environment scientific computing data analysis.Solution ArchitectureThe system built custom logic implementation filters programs checks past history program coach assigned before. not, allocates coach based availability feasibility reach program location time. filtered list coaches based preferences Age-Group Level created aid process.DeliverablesA Python script implementing CVRP-TW model. Test data scripts simulating scenarios. Documentation explaining model interpret results.Tech StackTools Python: primary programming language. Anaconda: Python distribution data analysis machine learning. Visual Studio Code: code editor development. Google App Script deployment integrated Google Language/techniques Python Models Constrained Vehicle Routing Problem Time Windows (CVRP-TW) Skills Data Analysis Machine Learning Optimization Algorithms Python Programming Databases CSV, Google Sheets: data initially stored CSV file, easily imported Python libraries pandas.What technical Challenges Faced Project ExecutionThe challenge developing custom logic implementation efficiently allocate coaches programs based specific criteria. challenge ensuring system handle scenarios multiple coaches required program.How Technical Challenges SolvedThe challenge addressed developing custom logic implementation filters programs checks past history program coach assigned before. not, allocates coach based availability feasibility reach program location time. challenge addressed initially focusing assigning single coach gradually introducing complexity multiple coaches basic system functional.Business ImpactThe implementation proposed solution significantly improved efficiency coach allocation process. system automated allocation process, saving valuable time resources previously spent updates. ensured coaches allocated minimizes travel ensures total work time exceed threshold.Project SnapshotsThe code project pushed GitHub: #heading=h.3pis0t8r68nfProject website url project Blackcoffer Team, Global Consulting firm.
