Title: Steps Convert Node.js API Python AWS Lambda Deployment Client BackgroundClient: leading consulting firm USAIndustry Type: & ConsultingProducts & Services: Consulting, Tech SupportOrganization Size: 50+The ProblemConverting Node.js API Python code AWS Lambda involves steps. First, create Lambda function select Python runtime. Then, translate Node.js handler function Python, ensuring performs logic. Next, include Python libraries deployment package. AWS API Gateway map HTTP requests Lambda function. Finally, package code dependencies, upload Lambda, test ensure works expected.Solution Architecture Setup AWS Lambda Environment:Create Lambda function AWS Management Console. Choose Python runtime environment. Translate Handler Function:Convert Node.js handler function Python. function entry point Lambda. Update Dependencies:Include Python libraries Lambda deployment package, similar Node.js dependencies. Configure API Gateway:Use AWS API Gateway map HTTP requests Lambda function. Deploy:Package Python code dependencies zip file upload Lambda. Test debug ensure Lambda function works expected.DeliverablesNew optimised python lamda function Tech StackTools AWS Lambda Management Console AWS API Gateway AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) AWS (Serverless Application Model) Boto3 (AWS SDK Python)Language/techniques usedPython AWS Lambda Functions AWS API Gateway Handler Functions Packaging DeploymentSkills Programming (Python) Serverless Computing (AWS Lambda) API Management (AWS API Gateway) Deployment Automation (AWS CLI AWS SAM) SDK (Boto3 AWS) Databases Amazon RDS Web Servers AWSWhat technical Challenges Faced Project ExecutionDuring project execution, common technical challenges include managing dependencies versions, ensuring compatibility environments (development, testing, production), handling scalability performance issues, integrating third-party services APIs securely, maintaining robust error handling logging practices debugging monitoring purposes. challenges require careful planning, testing, proactive troubleshooting ensure project’s success.How Technical Challenges SolvedTechnical challenges addressed rigorous testing version control manage dependencies effectively.
