Title: agent-based model Virtual (VPP) Client BackgroundClient: Leading Energy Firm USAIndustry Type: EnergyServices: Power, Energy, DistributionOrganization Size: 5000+Project ObjectiveTo create agent based model virtual Netlogo. function multiple plants worked simultaneously. plants created supplied energy based demand parameter controlled observerProject DescriptionThe client defined specific requirements wanted model be. requirements divided 4 parts. successive part increased complexity required model adjusted configured fit part itThe entire model completed contained parts defined client Statement work. SolutionCreated model requirements. clustering multiple agents position decided mathematically based total number agents sum energies. agents form cluster based condition sum figure threshold amount, threshold amount decided observer.Project Deliverables github model delivered client. uploads start basic model clustering agentsThe final upload model full representation VPP simulation. Tools used-Netlogo– python Language/techniques usedNetlogo specific language resembles logo language it’s unique syntax variations variables stored list parsed Models usedClusteringSkills usedNetlogo programming technical Challenges Faced Project ExecutionThe challenge controlling behavior agent model. lack understanding language resources made challenging figure actual behavior agents model. decision decide agent cluster grid difficult primarily agent spawned random screen. meant agent spot form cluster agents. challenge deciding condition agents cluster relative distance couldn’t parameter wasn’t relevant model’s purpose. Technical Challenges SolvedThe technical challenges solved extensive research referring forums span 2 months.
