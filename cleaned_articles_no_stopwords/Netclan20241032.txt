Mixed_Model_Identify APIPurpose: Identify datasets suitable mixed model analysis. Details: API analyzes dataset determine mixed model applications, identifying variables structure. Type_of_Column APIPurpose: Identify types columns dataset. Details: API examines dataset determine data types (e.g., categorical, ordinal, integer, real) column, aids data preprocessing modeling decisions.Tech StackTools Google Cloud, VScode, MongoDB Language/techniques Flask framework, Python language, MongoDB Database, OpenAI API Models Logistic ModelPurpose: Binary classification (e.g., yes/no outcomes). Details: Predicts probability binary response based predictors. Ordinal logistic ModelPurpose: Ordinal outcome variables (e.g., ratings). Details: Models outcomes defined order unknown distances. Nominal logistic ModelPurpose: Categorical outcomes order (e.g., types). Details: Models categorical responses inherent order. regression ModelPurpose: Count data modeling (e.g., event occurrences). Details: Models count events fixed interval. Multiple regression ModelPurpose: Multiple linear regression. Details: Predicts continuous outcome multiple predictors. Mixed ModelPurpose: Hierarchical grouped data. Details: Combines fixed random effects multi-level data. ModelPurpose: Survival analysis time-to-event data. Details: Models rates time. Survival ModelPurpose: Analyzes time events occur. Details: Focuses time-to-event data survival times. Skills Prompt engineering, flask, data modelling.
